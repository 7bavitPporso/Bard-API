## Lingaa Telugu Full Movie Download Utorrent Free: Movie Review
 
Lingaa is a movie that showcases the versatility and charisma of Rajinikanth, who plays a dual role of a grandfather and grandson. The movie has two parallel tracks, one set in the pre-independence era and the other in the present day. The movie is a mix of action, comedy, drama, romance, and sentiment, with a strong message of patriotism and social service.
 
The movie begins with the introduction of Lingaa, a petty thief who is released from jail by Lakshmi, a TV reporter who wants him to save the Solaiyur dam and temple built by his grandfather Raja Lingeswaran. Lingaa initially refuses to go with her, but agrees after he learns that there is a treasure hidden in the temple. He also meets Bharathi (Sonakshi Sinha), a village girl who falls in love with him.
 
The movie then shifts to the flashback, where we see Raja Lingeswaran, a benevolent king who cares for his people and their welfare. He decides to build a dam for Solaiyur village, which is facing drought and famine. He faces many hurdles from the British government, the local zamindar (Nizhalgal Ravi), and his own relatives who are jealous of his popularity. He also falls in love with Lakshmi (Anushka Shetty), a freedom fighter who supports his cause.
 
The movie alternates between the past and the present, as Lingaa learns about his grandfather's legacy and his sacrifices. He also realizes that Nagabooshan (Jagapathi Babu), a corrupt politician, is behind the plot to destroy the dam and the temple. He decides to fight against him and save the village from disaster. He also reconciles with Lakshmi and Bharathi, who are revealed to be descendants of Raja Lingeswaran's friends.
 
The movie ends with a grand climax, where Lingaa and his friends manage to stop Nagabooshan and his goons from blowing up the dam and the temple. Lingaa also retrieves the pen drive containing the proof of the dam's integrity from the temple. He then opens the temple doors and reveals the treasure to be a statue of Raja Lingeswaran. He pays tribute to his grandfather and dedicates the statue to the people of Solaiyur.
